# An Analysis of US House of Representatives Trading Activity


Here we will be diving into the current (117th) House of Representatives stock trades for the past two years. With help from the dataset provided by Timothy Carambat (https://housestockwatcher.com/api), the question I'm exploring is whether political parties in the House of Representatives have different or similiar trading activities. The dataset provides information such as the timeline of the transaction, ownership type, purchase type, and other details on the transaction. A key element missing from this dataset however, is each politicians political party which is essential in answering my question. In the following steps, I will be dissecting and analyzing my data to answer the question of whether there is a difference in stock trading behavior between political parties. I will use several exploratory data analysis methods to gauge and help answer my question.
